Title: Simple Python Keylogger

Description:
This repository contains a simple Python keylogger program designed to capture keyboard events and log them in both text and JSON formats. The keylogger is implemented using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the pynput library for capturing keyboard events.

Key Features:

GUI Interface: The keylogger includes a basic graphical user interface built with tkinter, allowing users to start the keylogging process easily.

Keylogging Functionality: The program captures keyboard events, such as key presses, key holds, and key releases, and logs them in real-time.

Dual Logging: Captured key events are stored in two formats - plain text and JSON. The plain text file ('logs.txt') records the entire sequence of keys pressed, while the JSON file ('logs.json') organizes the data into a structured format.

Responsibly Created: This keylogger is intended solely for educational purposes or personal use with appropriate permissions. It emphasizes ethical use and legal compliance with respect to privacy and data security.

Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone <url above you >
Install the required dependencies: pip install pynput
Run the keylogger: python keylogger.py
The GUI will prompt you to click the "Start Keylogger" button to initiate the logging process.
All captured key events will be saved in the 'logs.txt' and 'logs.json' files in the same directory.

This keylogger is meant for educational and ethical purposes, such as learning about keyboard event capturing and data logging. Please do not use it for any illegal or malicious activities.
Be mindful of your local laws and regulations regarding surveillance and keylogging. Always obtain proper consent from users before monitoring their activities.
